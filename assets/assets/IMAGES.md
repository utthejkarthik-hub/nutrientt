# assets/images - Suggested images & sources

This project links to high-quality free images from Unsplash for the hero and gallery. If you'd like to store images locally in the repo, add them under assets/images/ and update the <img src="..."> paths in index.html to point to those files (e.g. assets/images/hero.jpg).
